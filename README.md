# Fingerprint Recognition System based on Deep Learning Architecture


• A customized deep learning based fingerprint recognition system has
been developed using the multitask deep convolutional neural network
architecture to extract the fixed length representation from a high res-
olution fingerprint image.
• The recognition system calculates the cosine similarity score be-
tween the two representations to generate a distribution of genuine
and imposter scores.
